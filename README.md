- **Email-Gated Reports:** Generates a simple HTML report after capturing a user's email for lead generation.
- **REST API:** A clean backend API built with Python and Flask to handle all business logic.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, Flask, Flask-CORS
- **Database:** SQLite

## üõ†Ô∏è API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/simulate` | Run a simulation and return JSON results. |
| `POST` | `/scenarios` | Save a scenario to the database. |
| `GET` | `/scenarios` | List all saved scenarios. |
| `GET` | `/scenarios/:id` | Retrieve the details for a single scenario. |
| `DELETE` | `/scenarios/:id` | Delete a saved scenario. |
| `POST` | `/report/generate` | Generate an HTML report (email required). |

## üìù Potential Improvements

- **PDF Report Generation:** The initial plan was to generate a PDF report. Due to complex dependencies with the `WeasyPrint` library on Windows (related to GTK3), the feature was scoped to generate a functional HTML snapshot to meet the deadline.
- **User Authentication:** Adding user accounts to keep scenarios private.
